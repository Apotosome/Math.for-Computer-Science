**Problem 1.8.**
*Prove by cases that*
$$
max(r, s)+min(r, s)=r+s
$$
*for all real numbers r, s*



$Proof.$    The proof is by case analysis. Suppose  $r$ and $s$ are real  numbers. There are three cases:

1. $r>s$

2. $r<s$

3. $r=s$

**Case 1:** Suppose $r>s$, this implies that $max(r, s)=r$ and $min(r, s)=s$. Then,$max(r, s)+min(r, s)=r+s$.Thus, the proposition holds in this case.

**Case 2:** Suppose $r<s$, this implies that $max(r, s)=s$ and $min(r, s)=r$. Then,$max(r, s)+min(r, s)=r+s$. So the proposition holds in this case.

**Case 3:** If $r=s$, this implies that $max(r, s)=min(r, s) =r =s $ . Then,$max(r, s)+min(r, s)=r+s$. So the proposition holds in this case.

This implies that the proposition  holds all cases.

**Problem 1.14.**

Prove that if $a・b=n$, then either $a$ or $b$ must be $≤\sqrt n$, where $a,b$, and $n$ are nonnegative real numbers.



$Proof.$ We used proof by contradiction. Suppose the claim is false, and  if $a・b=n$, then both $a$ and $b$ must be $＞\sqrt n$.

​	Due to the limitation that $a,b$, and $n$ are nonnegative real numbers, we get  $a・b ＞ \sqrt n・\sqrt n=n$, which contradicts the supposition that $a・b=n$ . Thus, if $a・b=n$, then either $a$ or $b$ must be $≤\sqrt n$.
